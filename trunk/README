This is a simple learning language for kids to learn programming.

Features:
    easy to learn
    nice for small game programming

Provides:
    integrates graphics, to the level of sliding, sprites, etc.
    integrates a physical engine, together with advanced conflict processing.
    both compilable and intepretable, for easy and fun development.

Rules:
    the syntax must look similar to c++/java.
    provide a rich library, while keeping it simple and tiny
    as small set of data type and structures as possible
    less but powerful extension interfaces
    the goal is to guide the kids to program in a correct way
    use as least as possible details in syntax and other stuff, emphasis design other than language
